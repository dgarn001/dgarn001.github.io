#### Exciting things about me!
***
My research has involved undergraduates and has bridged field and molecular approaches. My recent focus has been on microplastics in Lake Champlain. We have also explored the prevalence of Lyme Disease in the North Country and continue to monitor animal movement via roadkill surveys using a smartphone app.

My teaching and research implements technology ranging from smartphones, tablets, GoPros, and drones. I am exploring active engagement of citizens by equipping them to become citizen sensors who actively document nature using smartphones and user-defined apps.

I received my B.S. in Biology at Villanova in 1998, worked for 2 years at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in a molecular diagnostics lab, and went on in 2005 to receive my Ph.D. at Penn State working on predator (bear)-prey (moose) interactions during the calving period using GPS collar technology.

I have taught varied courses in Ecology, Conservation, and Environmental Science in primarily undergraduate institutions and am an active board member within the Ecological Research As Education Network (EREN).

Most importantly, I am a **"baseball"** mom and dog lover.
